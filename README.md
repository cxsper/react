## CRA-based React templates

All templates reside in respective **branches**. All of them are based on top of TypeScript, ESLint for TypeScript, Husky, PWA, Storybook, SASS, [react-adaptive-hooks](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/react-adaptive-hooks) There you can find useful examples on how to make react work with:

* Electron (allows only in-memory or hash routing);
* Electron through express.js (allows any type of routing);
* MobX and MobX State Tree;
